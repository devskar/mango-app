### Incomes and Expenses

It works the following: You should be able to add Expenses and Incomes. They could be either scheduled (there also should be an option to select if its scheduled, but still needs a confirmation), one-time, or saved as a template.
Each Expense can have different categories: e.g. Car, Cinema (maybe even main category like hobbies, so that you have root category -> [child, categories]). The same goes for Incomes, but they have seperate categories. 

### Shares (need new name)

Shares are basically how you want to devide your monthly budget. For example you can say: I want to put 200€ every month into a virtual savings account to save money for my holiday. Or you want to say that 10% of my monthly income is supposed to go into a virtual bank account for retirement.

### Virtual Bank Account (vba)

A virtual bank account is pretty much the same as a bank account, just without any binding or hard setup. You give it a name and basically tahts it. From now on you can transfer money there scheduled or per hand, and also use that bank account for expenses. Basically a virtual bank account is ment to be a part of your normal bank account.

### Example

monthly income: 10.000€

vba's:
    - (1) Car
    - (2) Dog
    - (3) Retirement
    - (4) Cryptocurrencies
    - (5) Holiday 
    - (6) Household

monthly shares:
    1000€   -> vba6
    100€    -> vba1
    10%     -> vba3 
    10%     -> vba5
    10%     -> vba4
    rest    -> vba2
