### Transactions (Incomes and Expenses)

It works the following: You should be able to add Transactions. They could be either scheduled (there also should be an option to select if its scheduled, but still needs a confirmation), one-time, or saved as a template.
Each Transaction can have different categories: e.g. Car, Cinema (maybe even main category like hobbies, so that you have root category -> [child, categories]).

### Shares (need new name)

Shares are basically how you want to divide your monthly budget. For example you can say: I want to put 200€ every month into a virtual savings account to save money for my holiday. Or you want to say that 10% of my monthly income is supposed to go into a virtual bank account for retirement.

### Virtual Bank Account (vba)

A virtual bank account is pretty much the same as a bank account, just without any binding or hard setup. You give it a name and basically thats it. From now on you can transfer money there scheduled or per hand, and also use that bank account for expenses. Basically a virtual bank account is meant to be a part of your normal bank account.

### Example

monthly income: 10.000€

vba's:

<ol>
    <li>Car</li>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Retirement</li>
    <li>Cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li>Holiday</li>
    <li>Household</li>
</ol>

monthly shares:

<ul>
    <li>1000€ -> vba6</li>
    <li>100€ -> vba1</li>
    <li>10% -> vba3</li>
    <li>10% -> vba5</li>
    <li>10% -> vba4</li>
    <li>rest -> vba2</li>
</ul>
